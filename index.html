   <img id="profile" src="./assets/images/ajc.JPG" alt="AJC">As a graduate of George Mason University with a BA in Communication, I have professionally paired my education with my natural affinity for technology to find a passion for digital marketing. I primarily learned digital marketing skills in my previous position at KME.digital, where SEO/SEM and Google Analytics were a major part of my duties. <br><br>I am experienced in designing Adwords campaigns, conducting keyword research, managing social media accounts, and implementing best practices for on and off-site SEO. I am accustomed to conducting extensive research in order to understand an industry, target market, and determine appropriate cost-per-click. 

<br><br>
Additionally, I have a strong foundation of political knowledge and a keen interest in current events, having also minored in Government at GMU. I volunteered in the Obama '12 campaign, as well as the Perriello â€™17 campaign. <br><br>What a load of cobblers cup of tea chuffed marvelous Elementary my dear Watson the black death pulled a right corker, numbskull naff the lakes the black death wellies. A cracking Time Lord a bottle of plonk bloody shambles bogroll, the chippy up the duff bangers and mash ear hole it's me peepers, it's nicked throw a spanner in the works pulled a right corker.</p>
